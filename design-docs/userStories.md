# boardMatch

## Overview

boardMatch is a platform that connect service-oriented individuals with
non-profits in their local communities who are in need of board-level support.

## Motivation

Many communities enjoy vibrant non-profit and service-oriented communities.
However, these communities are often held back by a two-fold problem:

* Service-oriented individuals are unaware of the range of non-profits in their
    community, and often have not considered board-level involvement as a means
    of giving back and making a difference.
* Non-profits are limited by their current members' existing social and
    professional networks. They struggle to broaden their base of support by
    connecting with new individuals who are passionate about their cause.

boardMatch is a community-level platform on which individuals can create a
profile that summarizes their professional and service experience, and in which
ways they would most like to give back to their community. Non-profits can also
create profiles summarizing their organization, and highlighting open positions
on their boards. Individuals and non-profits can then reach out to each other,
building new connections and working together to strengthen their communities.
